## **Project Description**

This project aims to create an advanced predictive tool that forecasts water availability and demand in regions vulnerable to extreme hydrological events such as drought and floods.

---

## **Introduction**

Water scarcity and excess are critical challenges faced by many regions worldwide, particularly those prone to droughts and floods. These serious hydrological events may lead to severe socio-economic impacts, including agricultural losses, water supply shortages, and increased vulnerability of ecosystems. The need for effective water management is crucial, especially in the context of climate change, which worsens the frequency and intensity of such events.

### **Challenges & Need for Prediction Models**

- **Drought** is a complex natural hazard that impacts ecosystems and society in many ways (Chang & Guo, 2020).
- **Climate change** is expected to alter the hydrological cycle, resulting in large-scale impacts on water availability (Hagemann et al., 2013).
- The prediction of drought and flood onset remains a significant challenge, making accurate forecasting models essential (Nandgude et al., 2023).
  
AI and machine learning present promising solutions by efficiently extracting crucial information from vast datasets, which can help solve these complex water availability issues (Chang & Guo, 2020).

## **Problem Statement**

### **Current Challenges:**

- **Unpredictable rainfall** and fluctuating water availability make it difficult to balance supply and demand.
- **Lack of real-time predictive tools** for forecasting water availability.
- **Inefficient water resource allocation** during periods of scarcity or abundance.
- **Inadequate integration of climate data** and historical water usage trends in decision-making.

These challenges not only result in inefficient water use but also increase the vulnerability of communities. Immediate intervention through adaptive and predictive solutions is needed to safeguard water resources from the growing impacts of climate change.

## **Objectives**

### 1. **Climate-Driven Forecasting**
Develop a predictive tool that incorporates climate change projections and historical hydrological data to anticipate water availability.

### 2. **Water Demand Forecasting**
Create a forecasting system that accounts for historical water usage trends and socio-demographic factors.

### 3. **Decision Support**
Design and provide a user-friendly interface to aid stakeholders, including water managers and policymakers, in sustainable water resource planning.
